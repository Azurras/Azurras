			"text": "So I consider the new blog as a major upgrade to the site. Anyone who has visited before knows the vastness of this barren wasteland in terms of content. \n I plan on making many more major upgrades to the site. It's mostly a matter of when the planning phases of these projects will be complete that will determine when I'll work on these updates; however, you all can expect to see something new before the end of the year.",

			"text": "I've updated the header and footer of the site to use angular templates to remove any instances of me having to change anything in the nav or footer on multiple pages. You may notice a slow down in inital load times because of this. I have a few ideas for a fix and will probably have something out soon. If you want to take a crack at it you can find the issue at the link below.\n https://github.com/Azurras/Azurras/issues/11",

			"text": "So, it's been a while since the last post. I do have some news and it's that I've sold the Mac Mini. I am now using a gen 1 Raspberry Pi to host the site. Why? Well, I didn't think it was necessary anymore to have Mac Mini for just a webserver. I felt like it was a bit of a waste, so I downgraded. Anyway, I've also enabled file listing on the site so it'll be easy to see videos. I'll probably disable this soon, but for now you can visit www.azurras.com/assets/videos to see some old airsoft videos.",
