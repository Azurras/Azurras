                <p class="lead">
                    I have been playing video games since I was roughly 8 years of age. From then to the
                    age of 18, I casually played console games. Then, I built my first PC and got into more
                    time-consuming gaming.
                    These games included Rainbow Six Siege, World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, Battlefront, and
                    Battlefield. As for
                    single-players,I enjoyed playing strategy games such as XCOM,
                    Civilization, and Total War. I put in thousands of hours and hundreds of dollars into my Steam,
                    Origin, and other
                    platforms in the process. This was the norm for me until my senior year of college.
                </p>

                <!-- Rest of the blog text -->
                <p>At this stage in my
                    life, the ever-looming adult world was near, and the life of a student—a lifestyle that has been my
                    life for
                    nearly my entire existence—was ending. Finishing the year strong, finding a career, and staying fit
                    for the Army
                    National Guard were consistently on my mind. Because of this, my time gaming drastically decreased
                    as my
                    priorities shifted to put more time into tasks to further these goals.</p>
                <p>Fast forward a few
                    months, and the dust has settled—I graduated, found a satisfying career, and passed my yearly
                    physical training
                    test. Therefore, gaming fully returned to its place of power in my life again, right? Nope. The
                    competitive
                    shooter games were the first casualties. Simply put, I found the repetitive nature of FPS games
                    boring. You spawn
                    in, kill some stuff, get killed, and repeat. The occasional kill streak or close game brought some
                    excitement, but
                    it offered no new challenges, stimulation, or anything memorable. Perhaps another reason is because
                    I reached what
                    is the pinnacle of my skill in R6 back in college and made platinum rank. Not the most impressive
                    thing in the
                    world, but a huge personal achievement (which took several months to achieve) for me nonetheless.
                    After that,
                    though, what is next? I no longer had the time to grasp for a higher rank, and neither did my
                    teammates.</p>

                <p>My experience with
                    strategy/single player games did not meet the same fate. I found the design of these games to
                    consistently
                    challenge me in thoughtful ways with their long, drawn out campaign games having a lot of replay
                    ability due to
                    different difficulties, factions, and play styles. Being able to save and pick up the game again as
                    I pleased
                    allowed these games to fit into my busier schedule. The need to know the latest patch notes or to
                    understand the
                    constantly shifting meta of online games was an issue, though. Even though single-player games
                    filled my personal
                    needs better, I was still playing them much less than before.</p>

                <p>I believe this to
                    have been a realization of how my time used for hobbies could turn into long lasting products or
                    investments. For
                    example, I play airsoft and make videos about it. This not only increases my fitness, but also my
                    video editing
                    skills. Also, the YouTube channel’s growth from this is far more rewarding than any long session of
                    playing Call
                    of Duty and unlocking a weapon skin. Painting my Warhammer models also brings a level of
                    gratification, allowing
                    me to see my painting abilities increase. Seeing these models every time I play a game with them is
                    a constant
                    reminder of the fruits of my labor. Participating in a podcast or a blog does something similar; it
                    adds to a
                    meaningful skill and provides long term gratification.</p>

                <p>That is the key to
                    me: long-term vs. short-term gratification and personal development. Do not get me wrong—video
                    games, especially
                    strategy games, have taught me a lot about critical thinking and following directions, but they ran
                    their course
                    for me. A good match or a good game only grants satisfaction while you’re doing good during and
                    shortly after the
                    match. The competitive skills I obtain from playing the game will always be numbered by high school
                    kids or anyone
                    else who has more time to invest into games than I do. The only real long-term gratification comes
                    from being a
                    streamer or going pro. In the instance of MMOs, my entire grind means nothing when new expansion
                    releases and free
                    characters are handed out, undermining and devaluing all my hard work.</p>

                <p>
                    I am not trying to
                    sound high and mighty, right, or as though my way of thinking is the
                    only correct one. Nor am I trying to say strategy games are better than others or that games you
                    play are
                    pointless. I am simply trying to do a deep dive into my own reasons that caused something that was
                    so huge in my
                    life to slip away. What matters is you are living your life the way you want to live it. Personally,
                    as my life
                    changed, so did my interest.
